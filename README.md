# Automobile Dataset Prediction: Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning
## Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict automobile-related outcomes using various models. It involves the following steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Preprocessing the Data
3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation using MAE and RMSE
5. Hyperparameter Tuning for improving model performance
6. Model Comparison and Results

## Project Requirements

- Python 3.x or higher
- Libraries:
  -  pandas
  -  numpy
  -  matplotlib
  -  scikit-learn

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sadoklaoo/itds-assessement
cd
```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```
3. Download the dataset
Download the dataset: Make sure the dataset automobile.csv is in the working directory. You can download the dataset from [automobile.csv](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/10/data.csv) and save it as csv file in the same repository.
